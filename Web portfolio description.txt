My plan for this project was to create a simple web portfolio for my best friend Melina with an online gallery to showcase some of her art. I have included some of her works which when clicked on, take you to her online store where they can be purchased in various forms. I also have an about me page with some facts about her. I included a contact me page as well. I kept the design simple and gave each image on the home page a hover feature, so when your mouse is over top of them. This project was very challenging, but I feel like I’ve learned a lot from it. And even though it isn’t especially fancy, I put a lot of effort into it to get it to where it is now. I think I would like to work on it more in the future to make it look more professional and make it more clean looking. For the color scheme, I wanted to do something that reflected my friend. She is a pretty badass chick with electric green and black hair, so I made the colors of this web portfolio match that. I tried to make the page easy to navigate by putting the navigation par close to the top and giving it only three pages (home, about me, and a contact page). Overall, I am happy with how this project turned out, for not having any experience with this before. I tried my best with the time that I had to complete this project and even though it was difficult for me, I still had fun making it.
